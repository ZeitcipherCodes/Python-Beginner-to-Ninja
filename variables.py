Rules of variable assignment in python
1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z), or an underscore (_).
2. After the first character, variable names can include letters, numbers, and or an underscore

Tips:
    1. Use all-caps to declare a constant variable
    PI    = 3.14159
    GRAVITY    = 9.81
   2. Avoid using python built-in keywords as variable names.
   To get all python reserved built-in key words
   
   1. open the python terminal
   2. import keyword
   3. print(keyword.kwlist)
